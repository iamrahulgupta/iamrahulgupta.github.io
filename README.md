typescript:

Module structure:

* theme.ts - Theme toggle functionality
* scroll.ts - Scroll fade-in animations and navbar shrink
* analytics.ts - Google Analytics event tracking
* navigation.ts - Active nav links and smooth scrolling
* timestamp.ts - Last updated timestamp display

main.ts file:

* Imports all modules
* Has a clean entry point that initializes everything on DOMContentLoaded
* Is much more readable and maintainable
